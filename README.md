# Segmentation-of-Teeth-in-Panoramic-X-ray-Image
The aim of this study is automatic semantic segmentation and measurement total length of teeth in one-shot panoramic x-ray image by using deep learning method with U-Net Model and binary image analysis in order to provide diagnostic information for the management of dental disorders, diseases, and conditions.
