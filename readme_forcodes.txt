Firstly, you have to create your mask from original images.
Then , you can use data_resizing.py , data_preparing.py, data_augmention.py in order. 
However, you can only TensorFlow library for these. 
Finally, you can train model . 


data_resizing.py -->data_preparing.py, --> data_augmention.py(optional)-->model.py
